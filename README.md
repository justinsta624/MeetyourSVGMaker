## What to expect for this challenge?

* Build a Node.js command-line application takes in user-input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics).
* The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.
* Your application should use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests. </br>
  Each shape class should be tested for a render() method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.
* Your application should use [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user.
* To provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. </br>
  [Video Submission Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide)
* Include Triangle, Circle, and Square classes: any common functionality and properties shared from parent use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.

## User Story

```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```
